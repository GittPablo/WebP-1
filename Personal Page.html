			<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>"Live Your Movie"</strong></em>
			A catchphrase used by rapper Central Cee. It's his way of reminding the audience to always be true to<br> themselves. He exhorts them to live as though they are the protagonists of their own stories. Regardless of the situation, he<br>wants his audience to believe in the process and live their movie. Even if life won't always be luxurious, anyone can live a happy<br> life if they have an optimistic outlook.

	<p>When i got the results to the test, i laughed and said wow. For me, i think it described me perfectly. For my friends who are close to me will<br>mostly agree that i am an idealist. I believe i resonate with the healers personality in particular when doing some reflecting on myself.
