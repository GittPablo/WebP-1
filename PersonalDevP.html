I believe that the book “Twelve Pillars” was a great read. The name of the book is is used within the book as a way of life, as a principle<br>for a man named Michael. In the book, each chapter starts as a principle to how one should lead his life. Michael is introduced to the twelve pillar way<br>of life by Charlie who now plays a significant role in his life. Michael is a man who suffers from family estrangement and a job that does not pay him enough<br>to live the life he and his family want to live which leaves him searching for the identity he once had when he was younger.

Chapter Four, the fourth pillar, is entitled “Achieve your Goals”. The chapter speaks to setting goals and telling yourself how to achieve them.<br>Personally I believe it is a good custom, which is why I apply it for myself. Setting monthly goals on what I need to achieve to get to where I want to be<br>in life. What stood out to me within the chapter was Michael and Charlie’s conversation in the diner. Charlie refers to water a plant even when it has already<br>bloomed. Which is something that something that not many people practice including me, accomplishing something but not continuing to strengthen that foundation<br>by continue to put work into it.

Chapter 5, “The Proper Use of Time” clearly speaks to efficiently utilizing your time on things that help to achieve the goals you spoke to in the previous chapter.<br>This chapter was my favourite of the four. It reminded me of one of my high-school principals that would always say “A day has twenty-four hours in it, and its up to<br>you to spend it wisely.” The line in the chapter that refers to a day being expensive works hand in hand with my principals quotes and I totally agree. Although the<br>quotes speak to one doing activities that push towards what they want to achieve, it also speaks to living your life with no regrets, living your best life and doing<br>things that will bring you joy, which is something I like to practice.

Chapter 6, “Surround yourself with the Best People”. To me to surround yourself with the best people means to surround yourself with people who have the right<br>intentions with you and your well being. Could be someone who you can enjoy a day with and motivate you to work hard the next day, or even someone who can talk<br>you through rough times. People around you can have a major influence on your persona and I believe it is very important to always protect that. As a student,<br>especially a university student, it is always important to find persons, friends that encourage you to be your best self and achieve the best for yourselves, a<br>gritty personality.

Chapter 7, “Be a Life-Long Learner”. By just reading the title of the chapter I understood what it meant. I believe that one should never close themselves off to<br>learning new things. It is crucial as you may never know when and where it may come in handy. Complacency when it comes onto opportunities and learning something<br>new is something that I and many people I know are guilty of and also is constantly wanting more. I believe that the two work hand in hand meaning I am always<br>looking at my next step in life and most times these opportunities and experiences we seek require us to go the extra mile pick up an instruction manual or a book<br>to practice and conquer.

The four chapters covered, “Achieve Your Goals” , “The Proper Use of Time”, “Surround Yourself with the Best People” and “Be a Life-Long Learner” were phenomenal.<br>It is a book that encourages focusing and bettering yourself and it is one I would recommend to anyone I know.</p></pre>
	<p>For the past 4 years, I have been enrolled as a student at the University of Technology, Jamaica. I've noticed that I have great soft skills, I believe I have grit<br>in the sense that I dont think there's a task I cannot do which allows me to be a pretty good problem solver. Since being enrollde at the school, I have met many<br>different persons with many different personalities.The exchanges I have had with each and every one of them has allowed me to relate more to people and develop these<br>soft skills. Most of these individuals also push and encourage me which i think created this personality of getting tasks done and done correctly.</p>
